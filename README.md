# sunk_cost_timer

The Sunk Cost Fallacy describes our tendency to follow through on an endeavor if we have already invested time, effort, or money into it, whether or not the current costs outweigh the benefits.

I don't know about you, but I have two problems when doing projects:

1.  I spend way too much time on a project that's ultimately not worth it
2.  I get unmotivated because I feel like a project is too collosal to finish

This project is an attempt to help mitigate these issues.  The premise is simple.  At the beginning of a project I decide what the maximum number of hours I'm going to put into the project are.  If I hit that time limit, I put the project away and move on to something else.

This way:

1. I let go of projects that creep in scope and complexity or have too many barriers to make sense to proceed
2. I have an end in sight that I can target and know I can walk away from the project afterwards

## Use
clone the repo and `pip install sunk_cost_timer` this will install an executable you can run from your terminal.  Just type `sunk_cost_timer` and the first time the terminal will prompt you to enter a time limit for the project.  The program will create a file in pace called sunk_cost_time.txt that stores the time remaining and update it accordingly.  Next time you run the program it will use the time remaining in this file.
